usage:

  cloyster server DIRECTORY PORT
  cloyster server { -d DIRECTORY | -p PORT | -a AUTHFILE | -f BOUNCER | -n CLUSTER-NAME }

    Create a cloyster http server, hosting repositories in DIRECTORY and listening
    on PORT for incoming connections.
 
    If AUTHFILE is given, it should be a json file that maps usernames to
    token strings to use for basic auth protection for cloyster actions.
    
    Type `cloyster help ssl` to show ssl options.
    
    You can specify a BOUNCER module with -f to use a custom http router.

    If CLUSTER-NAME is given, it will be used as part of the node-discover encryption
    key. This will allow you to to run multiple clusters without having to 
        change the default node-discover port.

  cloyster ls { -r REMOTE | --verbose, -v | --format=FORMAT }
 
    List the running process branch names at REMOTE.
    
    Verbose formatting will use `branch,hash,repo,port`.
 
  cloyster work { -r REMOTE | --format=FORMAT }

    List the working directories from checked out git commits.
    The default FORMAT is `repo,commit,time,branch`.
 
    Active branches are shown with a trailing *.

  cloyster clean

    Remove unused working directories. These are the directories listed in
    `cloyster work` without a *.

  cloyster log NAME { -n ROWS | -f | -b BEGIN | -e END }

    Show ROWS of log output for the branch NAME like `tail`.
    Default -n value: screen height.
 
    Stream live updates when `-f` is set like `tail -f`.
    Slice log records for NAME directly with `-b` and `-e`.
 
  cloyster log { -n ROWS | -f | -b BEGIN | -e END | --color=true }

    Show ROWS of log output for all branches.
    Lines will be prefaced with a colored branch name when stdout is a tty.

  cloyster mv SRC DST { -r REMOTE }
 
    Move the branch name SRC to the DST branch name at REMOTE.
 
  cloyster rm NAME { -r REMOTE }
 
    Remove the branch name at NAME, killing any running processes.
 
  cloyster restart NAME { -r REMOTE }
 
    Restart the process at NAME.
 
  cloyster stop NAME { -r REMOTE }
 
    Stop the process at NAME.
 
  cloyster redecloyster NAME { -r REMOTE }
 
    Redecloyster the process at NAME, re-running install and test scripts.
